                            <p>I&apos;m a 62-year-old political commentator ‚Äî Norwegian by birth, but for the past 30+ years, I&apos;ve called sunny Spain my home. With roots in the cool north and decades of life experience in the vibrant south, I bring a truly European perspective to the global political conversation. üåç</p>
                            <p>Outspoken and extroverted, I thrive on real dialogue. I love talking to people ‚Äî in caf√©s, on the street, online ‚Äî because every conversation has the power to reveal something deeper about our society and the forces shaping it. I&apos;m a Gemini (yes, I own it!) with a touch of ADHD, which means I&apos;m relentlessly curious, constantly digging, always connecting the dots ‚Äî often before others even notice the lines.</p>
                            <p>My commentary is bold, honest, and unfiltered. I don&apos;t shy away from difficult truths, and I don&apos;t sit quietly when injustice rears its head. I fight for what&apos;s right, for the silenced voices, and for political transparency. üó≥Ô∏è I believe that hypocrisy ‚Äî whether in parliaments or pressrooms ‚Äî must be exposed, and I do it with clarity, humor, and conviction.</p>
                            <p>In a world clouded by misinformation and selective outrage, my mission is to bring clarity, context, and courage back to political discourse. If you&apos;re tired of the spin and looking for someone who tells it like it is ‚Äî with both fire and fairness ‚Äî you&apos;re in the right place.</p>
                            <p>Let&apos;s keep asking the hard questions and demanding better from those in power. The fight for truth is never over ‚Äî and I&apos;m not done talking. üé§</p>
